I'm compiling lists of IP addresses for both IN (entry) and OUT (exit) connections used by popular VPN services. Gathering both types is challenging since most services only make their IN servers publicly available. If you know of any additional VPN services with IN server details—or even better, have information on OUT servers—please contribute!

Use these lists to monitor outbound network requests or analyze successful login connections in your environment.


[VPN_ALL_IP_List.csv](https://github.com/mthcht/awesome-lists/blob/main/Lists/VPN/VPN_ALL_IP_List.csv) will automatically contain all the VPN lists content (with the important fields being src_ip, src_ip_entry,src_ip_exit) - combine all of them in one field
